### ABOUT ME

I'm a proven leader with experience in developing high-performance solutions, driving results and lean problem-solving.
 I've been able to leverage my concrete communication, collaboration and skills to find success throughout my career.

Currently, I am an Intern working on Predictive Maintenance at   Delhi Metro Railway Corporation. I am part of a team that is launching the very first predictive analytics solution in the history of DMRC.
I've been able to implement and improve processes that will leverage across the entire network of Rails.

Colleagues know me as an innovative thinker and productive worker that brings new ideas to most discussions and meetings. I tend to foster an ongoing dialogue between groups that I am a part of, to ensure every person can add to the pool of meaning and that, as a group, we make the best decisions possible.

For the future, I'm excited to build exponentially on skills like these.

In my free time I love to read , play videogames or contribute to opensource.
